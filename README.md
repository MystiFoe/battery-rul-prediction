## **Data Format**

For CSV uploads, the file must include the following columns:
- `type`: Operation type (-1, 0, 1)
- `ambient_temperature`: Temperature in degrees Celsius
- `battery_id`: Unique identifier for the battery
- `test_id`: Test identifier
- `Capacity`: Battery capacity in Ah
- `Re`: Electrolyte resistance in Ohm
- `Rct`: Charge transfer resistance in Ohm
