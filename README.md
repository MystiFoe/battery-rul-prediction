# Battery RUL Prediction

This project aims to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries using machine learning models such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. The dataset includes features like ambient temperature, battery ID, test ID, capacity, and degradation features. Various evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) are used to assess model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about battery characteristics, including type, ambient temperature, battery ID, test ID, and various performance metrics.

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Download the `battery-rul-prediction.ipynb` file.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Open the downloaded file using Jupyter Notebook.
4. Execute each cell in the notebook to train the models and evaluate their performance.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R2) on the test dataset.
