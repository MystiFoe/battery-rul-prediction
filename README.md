## **Model Evaluation**

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures average squared difference between predictions and actual values.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Calculates the average magnitude of prediction errors.
- **R-squared (R²)**: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.
